TODO
====
  * nicknames (@weekly, etc)
  * proper packaging (__init__, __all__, etc)
  * type up my cron grammar production assumptions
  * dedupe cronjob regex in cronjob.py and crontab.py

Notes
=====

Apparently, names aren't allowed to be used in lists or in ranges (ISC Cron
V4.1)! So be careful; right now, my implementation allows that.
